# hello-world
Me making my first repository on GitHub. Eeee!
I should really go to bed but I'm feeling inspired to learn to code. It could be because it's January, but I've been thinking about it for a while and have tried a few ways over the past two years. I recently read some articles by people using FreeCodeCamp and it has inspired me. I need to go to bed though. I don't sleep enough.
